<p>US manufacturers cheered as the euro, feeding on a US accounting crisis, punched its way above one dollar for the first time in more than two years.</p>

            <p>Even as Wall Street shook -- the Dow Jones index tumbled more than 400 points before regaining some composure -- manufacturers said the dollar's travails could help them by blazing a path for exports.</p>
            <p>Clambering out of a slowdown that cost about 1.5 million manufacturing jobs, they rubbed their hands at the prospect of a weaker dollar making their goods cheaper for overseas customers.</p>
            <p>Thomas Duesterberg, president and chief executive of Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said the breaching of dollar-euro parity was a psychological boost.</p>
            <p>"From the perspective of the manufacturing community, it is generally viewed as a positive sign," he said.</p>
            <p>"The value of the dollar had gotten so high that many domestic based producers were unable to compete effectively," Duesterberg said.</p>
            <p>"We would anticipate that in six months or so you would start to see more positive US exports than we are seeing now."</p>
            <p>Wall Street staged a dramatic turnaround. After losing more than 400 points at one stage, the Dow Jones finished the day down just 45.34 points, or 0.52 percent at 8,639.19.</p>
            <p>But the rally had little to do with a return of trust in corporate America. Rather, traders said, stocks rose as investors picked through the market wreckage in search of bargains.</p>
            <p>US President George W. Bush had sought to shore up confidence during a speech in Birmingham, Alabama, where he said the economy was on the way back and urged businesses to clean up.</p>
            <p>"I want you to know our economy is fundamentally strong," Bush said.</p>
            <p>The country had to rid itself of the hangover from the economic binge of the 1990s, Bush added. "Our country expects the highest ethical standards in corporate America," he said. </p>
            <p>John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia Securities, said the scandals had unleashed the market turmoil.</p>
            <p>"If you want to know what triggered the whole thing, clearly it was the question: 'What are these companies actually earning?'. Risk adjusted returns matter."</p>
            <p>The weaker dollar now threatened to weigh even more heavily on buckling stock markets as foreign investors feared the value of their stocks would slide with the dollar, he said.</p>

<p>For the economy as a whole, a weaker dollar initially boosts the trade deficit by raising the cost of imports. But over the longer term it helps exports and thus reins in the trade deficit.</p>

            <p>The bulging US deficit on its current account -- the widest measure of trade and financial flows -- was a key underlying factor in the reversal of the dollar's fortunes, experts said.</p>
            <p>"However, the value of the dollar won't collapse," said Wells Fargo chief economist Sung Won Sohn.</p>
            <p>Foreigners invested in dollar assets for two reasons, he said.</p>
            <p>"The preservation of capital is the foremost reason. During political and economic uncertainties, the demand for dollar assets as safe haven rises. Second, healthy economic growth and corporate profits in the United States should continue to attract foreign capital," Sohn added.</p>
            <p>"The United States will remain the locomotive pulling the rest of the world forward, offering higher risk-adjusted returns."</p>
            <p>Robert Sinche, head of global currency strategy at Citibank/Salomon Smith Barney, said the dollar's decline had been driven by richly-financed short-term traders, a seasonal summer lull in capital flows and the fear of more corporate scandals around the corner.</p>
            <p>Sinche noted that chief executives at top companies faced an August 10 deadline for signing off on the validity of their financial statements.</p>
            <p>"There is a real focus that if there are going to be new risks, new announcements and new disclosures, they are likely to come in the next few weeks," he said.</p>
            <p>US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan would seek to calm jangled nerves at a key semi-annual speech Tuesday to Congress, experts said.</p>
            <p>"I think his number-one objective is to assure everyone that we have low inflation, to assure everybody that we still have steady economic growth -- it is not an economic boom -- and to assure everybody that the Fed stands ready to do anything necessary to make sure that the payments system continues to work," Wachovia's Silvia said.</p>
