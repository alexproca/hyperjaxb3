Hyperjaxb3 release 0.3

Dear community!
I'm glad to announce the 0.3 release of Hyperjaxb3.


Hyperjaxb3 [1] is a JAXB [2] plugin which annotates schema-derived classes with Java Persistence API [3] annotations effectively making these classes persistent.

Hyperjaxb3 resolves a lot of incompatibilities between JAXB and JPA, taking into an account JPA limitations and JAXB peculiarities.
Generated annotations are 100% standard (no vendor extensions used) meaning your classes will be portable across EJB3 containers.
There are no database dependencies - you can persist your schema-derived classes in any database supported by your container.
Hyperjaxb3 supports a very large set of schemas - and we are working towards supporting all the schemas that JAXB supports.

Both generated and runtime code is stable and can be used in production.

Please visit the announcement page [0] for details, download and documentation links.
