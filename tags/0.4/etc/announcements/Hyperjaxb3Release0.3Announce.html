<p>Dear community! I'm glad to announce the 0.3 release of <a href="https://hyperjaxb3.dev.java.net">Hyperjaxb3</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://hyperjaxb3.dev.java.net">Hyperjaxb3</a> is a <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> plugin which annotates schema-derived classes with <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220">Java Persistence API</a> annotations effectively making these classes persistent.</p>

<p><a href="https://hyperjaxb3.dev.java.net">Hyperjaxb3</a> resolves a lot of incompatibilities between <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> and <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220">JPA</a>, taking into an account <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220">JPA</a> limitations and <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> peculiarities. Generated annotations are 100% standard (no vendor extensions used) meaning your classes will be portable across EJB3 containers. There are no database dependencies - you can persist your schema-derived classes in any database supported by your container. <a href="https://hyperjaxb3.dev.java.net">Hyperjaxb3</a> supports a very large set of schemas - and we are working towards supporting all the schemas that <a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a> supports.</p>

<p>Both generated and runtime code is stable and can be used in production.</p>
